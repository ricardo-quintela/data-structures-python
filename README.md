# Data structures in python

### Contents:
1. Linked List
2. Circular Linked List
3. Stack
4. Binary Tree

### Linked list
This structure associates knots with parent-child associations.  
The programmer can add unlimited content to the list and get items stored in it.

### Circular Linked List
The same as a Linked List but the last and the first elements are connected making it circular.  

### Stack
Stacks are first in first out data structures, meaning that the first element to be added is the last to be removed.  
The programmer can define a size to the stack that will be full when it reaches it's max capacity. It can also be cleared an the last elements can be removed (popped).

### Binary tree
Binary trees organize their elements in a specific order. Normaly the smaller elements are on the left branches and the bigger ones are on the right branches.  
This way of organizing data grants that all data will be in order from the moment the elements are added to the tree.  
The programmer can add elements, get specific elements and show all of the content in order.
